The main difference between a proxy server and a web server is that for requests that cannot be met from the locally stored files, a web server
responds "404 file not found" while when a proxy server is unable to fill a request from a client it acts as a client to a web server to 
fetch the requested file and then serve it from its cache/local storage.

the non 404 responses such as 403, 400, 411 etc remain the same along with 200, while 304 serves the cached file and 
a proxy server will only respond 404 when the origin server it acts as a client to responds 404.

A minimal proxy server would ensure that the requests are well formed (valid http get request) and check its cache for the requested resource. If it is found and still 
has time left to live then 304 is returned along with the resource. Otherwise it acts as a client to fetch the requested resource from the origin 
server and sends it to the origional client once the resource is recieved.
